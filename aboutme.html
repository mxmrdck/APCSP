    <p class="p">My Name is Max Murdock and some hobbies I have is to create art such as doodles or actual art pieces with my parents and friends. I do this every now in then, almost once every 2 weeks. We go to my house and complete these tasks not only to create art but to also spend time together. I used to play soccer with Piedmont but as it turns out, I am genuinely the worst player and had to drop the team. I now lift from time to time although my injury restricts some of the things I would like to do, but my friend and I had a whole schedule of which workouts to complete each day, at my house. I do like seeing the world as there are many different cultures that I have yet to see and cure my ignorance about the world and its people. </p>
