    <p class="p"> I am Max, and in APCSP I have completed many Projects. Some examples of this was the final performance tasks for both Semester 1 and 2. We also did a whole html unit in CodeHS while also practicing Java. For English, I have complete countless essays and projects to further my knowledge not only with proper ways to write but also growing my knowledge about the English Language. In Spanish, which I have studied for 4 years, we do projects about ourselves, holidays, and other topics related to the language. </p>
